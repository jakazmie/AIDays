    "# Part 1 - Feature Engineering\n",
    "In this section of the lab we will develop and run a Python script that pre-processes training and validation images into a set of powerful features - refered to in the lab as bottleneck features.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create bottleneck features we will utilize a pre-trained Deep Learning network that was trained on a general computer vision domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "As explained by your instructor this approach is called Transfer Learning. Transfer Learning is a powerful Machine Learning technique that is based on an observation that the knowledge gained while solving one problem can be applied to a different (but related problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of an image classification task, a DNN trained on one visual domain can accelerate learing in another visual domain. Although, our pre-trained network does not know how to classify aerial land plot images, it knows enough about representing image concepts that if we use it to pre-process aerial images, the extracted image features can be used to effectively train a relatively simple classifier on a **limited number** of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below diagram represents the architecture of our solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Transfer Learning](https://github.com/jakazmie/AIDays/raw/master/DataScientistTrack/02-AML-EndToEndWalkthrough/images/TLArch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **ResNet50** trained on **imagenet** dataset to extract features. We will occasionally refer to this component of the solution as a featurizer. The output of the featurizer is a vector of 2048 floating point numbers, each representing a feature extracted from an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use extracted features to train a simple fully connected neural network (FCNN) to classify aerial land plot images. We could use any other classification algorithm - e.g. logistic regression or decision trees but FCNN gives us a lot flexibility in fine tuning the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python script generated by the next Jupyter cell processes an input image dataset into an output bottleneck feature set. The script expects the images to be organized in the below folder structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "train/\n",
    "   Barren/\n",
    "   Cultivated/\n",
    "   Developed/\n",
    "   Forest/\n",
    "   Herbaceous/\n",
    "   Shrub/\n",
    "valid/\n",
    "   Barren/\n",
    "   Cultivated/\n",
    "   Developed/\n",
    "   Forest/\n",
    "   Herbaceous/\n",
    "   Shrub/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of the input dataset and the location where to save the output dataset are passed to the script as command line parameters. The output dataset will be stored in a binary HDF5 data format used commonly in Machine Learning and High Performance Computing solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script is designed to work with a large number of images. As such it does not load all input images to memory at once. Instead it utilizes custom Python generator class - `ImageGenerator` to feed the **ResNet50** featurizer. The class yields batches of images - as Numpy arrays - preprocessed to the format required by **ResNet50**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will not attempt to run the script in a local environment. It is very computationally intensive and unless you run it in an evironment equipped with a powerful GPU it would be very slow. It would be *painfully* slow if you attempt to run it in Azure Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we will run the script on a remote Azure GPU VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your instructor will dive into the code in the script and explain key snippets."
