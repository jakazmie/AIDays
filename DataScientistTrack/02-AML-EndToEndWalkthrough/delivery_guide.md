# Instructor Delivery Guide.

This lab was designed to be instructor led. It is expected that the instructor will walk students through the lab's notebooks

This is the recommended flow through the lab. By no means this is cast in stone. Please feel free to fine tune based on your 
audience and you areas of expertise.
