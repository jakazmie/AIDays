# Azure Machine Learning service End-To-End Walkthrough

The goal of the lab is to introduce key components and features of Azure Machine Learning service. During the lab you will go through the full Machine Learning workflow from data preparation, through model training, to model operationalization.

The lab is not designed to explore all Azure ML features in detail. If you want to go deeper ask your instructor about Microsoft Technology Center Azure Machine Learning workshops.

## Lab environment set up

If you are using Azure Data Science Virtual Machine and you have stepped through the setup instructions you are ready to go.

To set up the environment on Azure Notebooks upload the lab's Jupyter notebooks to your Azure Notebooks library:

1. Navigate to your Azure Notebooks library.
2. Click on **+** icon.
3. Click on **From URL**
4. In **File Url** paste the below link
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakazmie/AIDays/master/DataScientistTrack/02-AML-EndToEndWalkthrough/00-intro.ipynb
5. Click **Upload**
6. Repeat for:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakazmie/AIDays/master/DataScientistTrack/02-AML-EndToEndWalkthrough/01-train.ipynb
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakazmie/AIDays/master/DataScientistTrack/02-AML-EndToEndWalkthrough/02-deploy.ipynb

Start `00-intro.ipynb` to begin the lab.

Enjoy.
